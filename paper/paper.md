# Introduction

As part of the BioHackathon SWAT4HCLS 2024, we here report on the topic AI prompt engineering for SPARQL. During the introductions we noticed that there is a possible overlap between this project and the other project Beyond the VoID. 

## Overview of Related work / projects

## WikiPathways VoID use case

<!-- discuss with Marvin -->

 Involved: Jerven (code fixes), Egon testing, Marvin (WP SPARQL endpoint), Tooba testing ...


* things found
    * graph IRI wrong for `servicedescription` (Egon/Marvin)
        * discussed, will be updated
    * Virtuoso limit to 10k impacts output (Egon/Marvin)
    * statistics on GPML/WPRDF separation needed (or only WPRDF)
        * e.g. http://rdf.wikipathways.org/wprdf/ for the WPRDF, and  http://rdf.wikipathways.org/gpmlrdf/ for the GPMLRDF
        * also ontologies in separate graphs? 
            * Why? we migt be intereted in the usage of the ontologies
    * license? CCO for WikiPathways, but how to communicate the license for each dataset?
    *  
    * running the SPARQL queries to check VoID statistics 

### WikiPathways FDP use case

* Fixed mime type of FDP Turtle files (Egon, Eric)
* Tested WikiPathways FDP with Mark's tool

TODO:

* add Service Description
* figure who to communicate which diseases are found in WikiPathways
    * this is the connection to the VoID statistics work in Project 8

### VoID support in Comunica

The following shows the performance results of a prototypical implementation of VoID-based cardinality estimation
Cardinality estimation using VoID is done based on the heuristics of "Hagedorn, Stefan, et al. "Resource Planning for SPARQL Query Execution on Data Sharing Platforms." COLD 1264 (2014)".

For endpoints not exposing VoID metadata, Comunica falls back to sending COUNT queries.

## VoID auto-generator
Involved: Yasunori, Tarcisio

We started the evaluation of two VoID metadata generators, namely, void-generator and Triple Data Profiler. First, we evaluate if the generated metadata are complementary or the same. We noticed that they are indeed complementary to each other. Secondly, we aimed at combining their results to produce a more complete VoID-based description of a given RDF data source. We found out that merging both tools' VoID results is not straightforward. We identified that the generated output by the tools are structured in different ways even though both rely on VoID.

## ChEMBL VoID use case

Involved: Ammar 

ChEMBL [@cites:10.1093/nar/gkr777], a prominent bioactivity database, plays a crucial role in drug discovery and chemical biology research. It houses vast amounts of data relating to the interactions between small molecules and their biological targets. Leveraging Semantic Web technologies, ChEMBL provides a SPARQL endpoint, enabling users to query its data using the RDF data model [@usesDataFrom:10.1093/bioinformatics/btt765].

On the other hand, VoID (Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets) [@cites:Zhao/11/DLD] serves as a metadata standard for describing RDF datasets. It facilitates the discovery and integration of linked data by providing essential information about datasets, such as their structure, statistics, and relationships with other datasets. By generating a VoID file for the ChEMBL SPARQL endpoint, users gain insights into the dataset's characteristics, enabling better utilization and integration with other linked datasets.

The ChEMBL Core Ontology (CCO) encapsulates the essential concepts and relationships within the ChEMBL dataset in an RDF-compatible format. It defines classes and properties to represent entities such as compounds, targets, assays, and activities, fostering interoperability and standardization in bioactivity data representation. By querying the ChEMBL SPARQL endpoint for predicates within the CCO, researchers can uncover significant patterns and relationships present in the dataset, aiding in various analyses and investigations, such as target identification, compound profiling, and drug repurposing efforts.

During the [SWAT4HCLS](https://swat4hcls.org) BioHackathon 2024, a task was carried out aiming at creating a VoID file for the ChEMBL SPARQL endpoint. That was facilitated through the utilization of the [void-generator](https://github.com/JervenBolleman/void-generator) tool. The outcomes of this process have been shared within this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ammar257ammar/SWAT4HCLS-BioHackathon-void). Following this, the generated [void.ttl](https://github.com/ammar257ammar/SWAT4HCLS-BioHackathon-void/blob/main/void.ttl) file along with the [cco.ttl](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/ChEMBL-RDF/latest/cco.ttl.gz) ontology file were imported into a triple store (GraphDB), and thorough exploration was performed via SPARQL. To delve deeper into the usage of the ChEMBL Core Ontology (CCO) properties, a specific SPARQL query (shown below) was formulated to extract the top 20 predicates based on their frequency of occurrence within the dataset, alongside the enumeration of distinct subjects and objects associated with them.

```sparql
PREFIX void: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

select ?propertyDescription ?triples ?distinctSubjects ?distinctObject where { 

    ?s void:property ?property.
    ?property rdfs:label ?propertyLabel.
    
    ?s void:triples ?triples .
    ?s void:distinctObjects ?distinctObject.
    ?s void:distinctSubjects ?distinctSubjects.
    
    BIND(CONCAT(
            REPLACE(
                STR(?property),
                "http://rdf.ebi.ac.uk/terms/chembl#", 
                "chembl:"), 
            " (", 
            ?propertyLabel, 
            ")") 
        AS ?propertyDescription)
    
} order by DESC(?triples)
LIMIT 20
```



Below is the resulting table of the top 20 predicates based on their frequency of occurrence within the ChEMBL RDF dataset.

## VoID testing on my local GraphDB

[ENPKG](https://enpkg.commons-lab.org)+ more stuff

Many queries with are MALFORMED QUERY


GraphDB freezed after 66444 queries. Last VoID messages:

```

```

I am ready to try it again after the next round of bugs fix :-))



## Validating a given SPARQL query against the VoID description of the target KG

The idea is to eliminate errors e.g. due to hallucinations in the generated SPARQL queries, by cross-checking the URIs in the query against the available URIs in the VoID description.



# AI Prompt engineering for SPARQL

## Setting up local virtuoso triple store

We installed virtuoso and loaded the drungbank database into the triple store. We already had prepared a .nq version of Drugbank, which had been created from a xml file downloaded on 4th of January 2023 from Drugbank (for academic use only) [@citesAsRelated:Wishart2017].
That file had been translated into nquads using scripts from Bio2RDF.

'php runparser.php parser=drugbank download=false files=all indir=<path1> outdir=<path1> registry_dir=<path3>'
    
[citesAsSourceDocument https://github.com/bio2rdf/bio2rdf-scripts]    

With the following steps:

Running the docker

- configuring the virtuoso.ini:
   ```DirsAllowed              = ., ../vad, /usr/share/proj, /data```

- copy the drugbank.nq to local /data volume

### Starting the Virtuoso client:

We used the isql console to load some data via the bulk loader:
  ```isql 1111 dba dba```


The ld_dir command is used to select which data to load (in this case /data/drugbank.nq).
 ```ld_dir ('/data', '*.nq', 'http://localhost:8890/drugbank') ;```

To bulk load the data into the Virtuoso server:
  ```rdf_loader_run();```

To prevent a rollback when restarting the container:
  ```checkpoint;```

The drungbank graph is now locally available through the browser at localhost:8890


## Sample Queries

### Getting simple drug information

We chose Aspirin as a sample drug and ask for the "DrugID"


#### A remark to the reproducibility of the LLM queries

Prompting LLM usually send also the context in each query.
The AI improves its answers based on the context.
To reproduce a certain result one would require to reproduce the whole history of prompts of a session. 
We descided to **first find prompts leading to reasonable results**
and then reset the session and generate an optimised series of prompts to come to at least somewhat reproducable results, starting from scratch.


### Retrieving some basic information
#### The easy way: 

ChatGPT-prompt: What is the DrugbankID of Aspirin?

ChatGPT 3.5 reply:

```
The DrugBank ID for Aspirin is DB00945.
```


ChatGPT 4.0 reply:

```
The DrugBank ID of Aspirin is DB00945 (citation: https://www.drugs.com/ingredient/aspirin.html).
```

In this case the result was correct in both cases, no halucination and in GPT4 even a source for the valid result.

#### Requesting the URI of Aspirin via SPARQL:     

ChatGPT-prompt:

```
We are using a SPARQL endpoint of drugbank database. 

Generate a SPARQL query to retrieve the DrugID of aspirin

Use "aspirin" as the label to find right URI
```


Expectation:
We expect a releatively basic SPARQL query in the form of 

SELECT ?drug
WHERE {
  ?drug rdfs:label "Aspirin".
}


Respones
ChatGPT 3.5:

```sparql
PREFIX db: <http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/drugbank/resource/drugbank/>

SELECT ?drugID
WHERE {
  ?drug db:commonName "aspirin" .
  ?drug db:drugbankId ?drugID .
}
```

Prefix was "invented", therefore we refined the query:





SPARQL (chatgpt 4):

```sparql
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX db: <http://drugbank.ca#>

SELECT ?drugID
WHERE {
  ?drug rdfs:label "aspirin"@en .
  ?drug db:drugID ?drugID .
}
```

The prefix rdfs is correct, the prefix `http://drugbank.ca#` is invented, but fits to the website of drugbank. ChatGPT in version 4 tells us, that we need to specify the prefix, while ChatGPT version 3.5 did not warn about that.



#### Adding more details to the prompt

ChatGPT-prompt:

```
We are using a local SPARQL endpoint of drugbank database. 
The prefix of the graph is should be: 
dbank: http://bio2rdf.org/drugbank_resource
It is stored in a graph called <http://bio2rdf.org/drugbank_resource:bio2rdf.dataset.drugbank.R5>
To explore the structure of the database, a good start would be to look for a known drug like aspirin.
Generate a SPARQL query to retrieve the URI of Aspirin.
Use "aspirin" as the label to find right URI.
Do not assume that it has the rdf:label predicate but an english language tag. 
```


Expectation:

PREFIX dbank: <http://bio2rdf.org/drugbank_resource:>
SELECT DISTINCT ?drugURI
WHERE {
  GRAPH <http://bio2rdf.org/drugbank_resource:bio2rdf.dataset.drugbank.R5> {
    ?drugURI ?predicate "Aspirin"@en.
  }
}

ChatGPT 3.5 reply:

```
PREFIX dbank: <http://bio2rdf.org/drugbank_resource>

SELECT ?drug_uri
WHERE {
  GRAPH <http://bio2rdf.org/drugbank_resource:bio2rdf.dataset.drugbank.R5> {
    ?drug_uri ?p ?o .
    FILTER (str(?o) = "aspirin"@en)
  }
}


```

The result is almost correct: only the capitalisation and the language tag was wrong.

How it should be:
    
```
PREFIX dbank: <http://bio2rdf.org/drugbank_resource>

SELECT ?drug_uri
WHERE {
  GRAPH <http://bio2rdf.org/drugbank_resource:bio2rdf.dataset.drugbank.R5> {
    ?drug_uri ?p ?o .
    FILTER (str(?o) = "Aspirin")
  }
}


```

Running the corrected query, resulted in two hits :)


ChatGPT 4.0 reply:

```
Given the requirements and the prefix for the DrugBank database, a SPARQL query to find the URI of Aspirin, where "aspirin" is the label with an English language tag, would look like this:

PREFIX dbank: <http://bio2rdf.org/drugbank_resource>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?aspirinURI
WHERE {
  GRAPH <http://bio2rdf.org/drugbank_resource:bio2rdf.dataset.drugbank.R5> {
    ?aspirinURI rdfs:label "aspirin"@en.
  }
}
    
In this query:

The PREFIX lines define short names for the URIs that will be used in the query. dbank is set as the prefix for DrugBank resources, and rdfs is the prefix for the RDF Schema vocabulary, which includes the label property.
The SELECT line specifies that we want to retrieve the URI of Aspirin, which we're calling ?aspirinURI in the query.
The WHERE clause specifies the pattern to match in the data. We're looking for a resource (?aspirinURI) within the specified graph (<http://bio2rdf.org/drugbank_resource:bio2rdf.dataset.drugbank.R5>) that has an English language label (rdfs:label "aspirin"@en).
This query assumes that the label for Aspirin is exactly "aspirin" and tagged with @en for English. Depending on the specifics of the data, you might need to adjust the query if, for example, the label includes additional information or uses a slightly different form (e.g., capitalization).
```

The query gave no results due to the spelling "aspirin"@en instead of "Aspirin"@en. That has been described as one of the potential weaknesses.
    

#### What we actually found out:

```
PREFIX dbank: <http://bio2rdf.org/drugbank_resource:>
SELECT DISTINCT ?drugURI ?predicate ?s
WHERE {
  GRAPH <http://bio2rdf.org/drugbank_resource:bio2rdf.dataset.drugbank.R5> {
    ?drugURI ?predicate "Aspirin"@en.
    ?s ?p ?drugURI.
  }
}
```

The DrugID of Aspirin is actually not the same URI that is connected to the label "Aspirin"@en directly, but indirectly via "http://bio2rdf.org/drugbank_vocabulary:synonym" so we actually need 2 hops to find the DrugID from the URI.
This is unexpected and not solvable without presenting ChatGPT the graph structure using prior knowledge or additional information.

## Refining the query with by generating the Drugbank graph Schema

We are investigating the Drugbank represented as Linked Data. Therefore, we are interested in building the ontology/schema to see the structure of the data. Therefore we used the following SPARQL query that we borrowed from [Bio2RDF_query_Dumontier](https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/#s6_6) :

```
SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?s) AS ?scount) ?stype ?p ?otype  (COUNT(DISTINCT ?o) AS ?ocount)  
{ 
 ?s ?p ?o . 
 ?s a ?stype .
 ?o a ?otype .
} GROUP BY ?p ?stype ?otype
```

This query shows the structure of different types, but lacks of predicates and literals.
    
## Further queries to test

Augment the catalog of queries on DisGenet, using more complex queries.
